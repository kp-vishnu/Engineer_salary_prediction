Software Engineer I,$85K - $121K (Glassdoor est.),4.2,"The Trade Desk
4.2","The Trade Desk is a global technology company with a mission to create a better, more open internet for everyone through principled, intelligent advertising. Handling over 1 trillion queries per day, our platform operates at an unprecedented scale. We have also built something even stronger and more valuable: an award-winning culture based on trust, ownership, empathy, and collaboration. We value the unique experiences and perspectives that each person brings to The Trade Desk, and we are committed to fostering inclusive spaces where everyone can bring their authentic selves to work every day.
Do you have a passion for solving hard problems at scale? Are you eager to join a dynamic, globally-connected team where your contributions will make a meaningful difference in building a better media ecosystem? Come and see why Fortune magazine consistently ranks The Trade Desk among the best small-medium-sized workplaces globally.
Software Engineer I
About the Role:
Our Engineers are end-to-end owners. You will participate actively in all aspects of designing, building, and delivering products for our clients.
We have dozens of individuals, mission-focused teams working across a wide spectrum of technological challenges. You will have the opportunity, depending on your interests and aptitude, to work on large-scale distributed systems coordinating thousands of servers in cloud and physical data centers around the world, petabyte-scale data challenges, machine learning, advanced visualizations, and interactive user interfaces – to name a few.
Who We Are Looking For:
You have a sustained track record of making significant, self-directed, and end-to-end contributions to large and impactful software projects. You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the 'why' behind what you are doing.
You understand engineering fundamentals. At our scale, many off-the-shelf techniques and existing technologies (open source and enterprise) simply don't work. You are able to work from first principles to evaluate solutions and adapt them to a unique environment.
You are a broadly skilled engineer, accustomed to developing web services. You have experience building always-on systems, working across a variety of technologies and service layers.
You have a product-focused mindset. You have the passion and ability to contribute to the process of discovering what will delight our clients and push forward one of the world’s largest and most influential industries toward a vision of openness, transparency, and evidence-based decision-making.
You work with confidence and without ego. Our engineers have deep knowledge and exercise a high degree of leadership in their daily work. You have strongly-held, defensible ideas, and advocate for what you believe is right. You are also adept at identifying and evaluating trade-offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to support your fellow teammates.
You value, seek out, and foster diversity. We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground.
You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done"". What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need engineers who know all the answers; we need engineers who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.
What We Care About:
What and how you can contribute is what’s important to us. Our consideration is not limited by the kind of education you have or the specific technologies you have experience with. Variety of technical challenge is one of the best things about working at The Trade Desk as an engineer, but we do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start. What we care about is that you can learn quickly and solve complex problems using the best tools for the job.
Our culture runs much deeper than just having fun together (though, we do that well too...) – the people we want on our team are trust-builders, generous givers, scrappy problem solvers, and gritty pursuers of excellence.
Does this sound like you? If so, we welcome your application and the chance to meet you.
The Trade Desk does not accept unsolicited resumes from search firm recruiters. Fees will not be paid in the event a candidate submitted by a recruiter without an agreement in place is hired; such resumes will be deemed the sole property of The Trade Desk. The Trade Desk is an equal opportunity employer. All aspects of employment will be based on merit, competence, performance, and business needs.

Who we are
We care deeply about our customers: investors, fund managers, fund administrators, tax/audit professionals, and others. We are relentless in our pursuit to create leverage for them. We do so by deeply understanding the domain and the jobs to be done. We run towards hard and messy problems. We serve the business, first and foremost, and invest in ourselves and each other in service of that effort. We are owners and that is the only title that matters.
We take our work seriously, but not too seriously. We take equal pride in solving complex business problems like automating allocation calculations, as we do contributing to our Slack emoji portfolio. Stand-ups might include discussions on implementation details for a new Kafka event or our favorite microwavable snacks.
Your Role at Carta
You will join our R&D team of learners, builders, experts, and leaders in our Venture Capital group. Our group is building the next generation of software for the venture capital industry. We build software to help new funds launch, investors to track analytics and performance, for fund accountants operating the books and financial records for investment funds ranging from $100k through billions under management, and more. We work on a mix of greenfield opportunities and work informed by metrics.
About You
Whether you are a new college graduate or a Staff Engineer with 10 years of leadership experience, you continuously strive to improve yourself and those around you. Additionally,
You have strong technical skills and are an excellent collaborator.
You like solving for ambiguity: we’ll look to you for ideas on how to solve problems.
You implement systems large or small that are clear, maintainable, and correct.
You are excited by opportunities to both break ground on new projects and provide fresh perspective onto past implementations.
You want to build and own your work end-to-end.
You are eager to move fast, but recognize when to build for the future.
You may be passionate about some elements of the Carta tech stack (Python, Django, Javascript, React, Postgres, GRPC, Kafka); such experience is helpful but we do not require it.
We look for candidates who are interested in, experienced with, or curious about…
Accounting or investment management
Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology
Customer relationship management
Document data extraction and digital signatures
Tax reporting and financial auditing
Banking and money movement
The Interview Process
Carta follows a standard tech startup interview process, where you will meet with a recruiter and hiring manager first. We’ll then ask you to show off your skills with a real-world take home exercise (we do not do LeetCode-style interviews, no one will quiz you on writing a doubly-linked list) and virtual interviews. During the process, you can ask questions to people across different parts of the Venture Capital team to learn what kind of work we do and how it lines up with your interests.

We are an equal opportunity employer and are committed to providing a positive interview experience for every candidate. If accommodations due to a disability or medical condition are needed, connect with us via email at recruiting@carta.com. As a company, we value fairness, helpfulness, transparency, leadership and build our teams around these values.

4.9","About Us:
We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.
We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.
What You'll Achieve:
You'll work with others to build new product features from start to finish: through conception, research, implementation, and maintenance. For example, you might build an editor for inline mathematical equations.
You'll help improve performance and reliability, or polish existing features. For example, you might make it easier to select text across multiple paragraphs.
You'll build internal tools to support simplicity and productivity for the whole team. This might include writing a script to import user feedback into Notion.
Skills You'll Need to Bring:
Thoughtful problem-solving: For you, problem-solving starts with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You can decompose tricky problems and work towards a clean solution, by yourself or with teammates. You're comfortable asking for help when you get stuck.
Shipping quality user interfaces: You can work with others to build and maintain quality user interfaces for a big audience, using Web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a modern UI framework like React. If you've experienced the technical challenges of rapid growth, that's a plus.
Familiarity with the backend: You understand how parts of a system fit together—from the user interface to the data model. Experienced candidates should be familiar with relational database systems like Postgres or MySQL.
Pragmatic and business-oriented: You care about the business impact of what you're building, and you prioritize projects accordingly. You're not just going after cool stuff—you understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line.
Put users first: You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad.
Not ideological about technology: To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go.
Empathetic communication: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed.
Team player: You understand when work is better, together. You enjoy collaborating cross-functionally to accomplish shared goals, and you care about learning, growing, and helping others to do the same.
Nice to Haves:
You're proficient with any part of our technology stack: React, TypeScript, Node.js, and Postgres.
You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work.
You have interests outside of technology, such as in art, history, or social sciences.
We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you're excited about a role but your past experience doesn't align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you're a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

About the Role
Remember the first time you solved a problem by programming? The delight and excitement you felt when it finally...worked? We want to deliver that experience to everyone by giving them the building blocks to create useful tools of all kinds—without needing to code. That's been the vision of computing pioneers since the 70s. Today, all the infrastructure is present, but we need your engineering to pull it off.
What You'll Achieve:
You'll work with others to build new product features from start to finish: through conception, research, implementation, and maintenance. For example, you might build an editor for inline mathematical equations.
You'll leverage your frontend knowledge to help improve performance and reliability, and polish existing features. For example, you might make it easier to select text across multiple paragraphs.
You'll work across the stack to implement features end-to-end. For example, you might build a new sidebar for displaying page comments, and over the course of implementing it you may modify an existing Node.js endpoint to fetch comment data upon page load.
Skills You'll Need to Bring:
Thoughtful problem-solving: For you, problem-solving starts with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You can decompose tricky problems and work towards a clean solution, by yourself or with teammates. You're comfortable asking for help when you get stuck.
Familiarity with frontend technologies: You're familiar with the DOM, CSS, Javascript, and a React-like UI framework. Based on experience and knowledge of the state of the art in frontend, you make pragmatic suggestions for how to improve our frontend tooling and abstractions. If you've experienced the technical challenges of rapid growth, that's a plus.
Navigating ambiguity in design: You can translate high level designs into production-ready UI. Given clear requirements, you are comfortable making judgment calls on tradeoffs and edge cases in the user experience on your own. You don't need to see every interaction mocked out ahead of time, but you actively partner with designers to suss out the details when the requirements are unclear.
Shipping quality user experiences: You elevate the quality of the product by proactively identifying user experience problems before they ship. You don't just flag issues for others to solve—you communicate potential alternatives and brainstorm solutions with your teammates.
Pragmatic and business-oriented: You care about the business impact of what you're building, and you prioritize projects accordingly. You're not just going after cool stuff—you understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line.

Jr. C# Software Developer (Permanently Remote),Employer Provided Salary:$35K - $70K,-1.0,Clarity Ventures,"The Jr. C# Software Developer will write C# .Net customizations to meet project requirements for specific implementations of our eCommerce, Integration and other custom application development projects. This work is based on detailed wire frames, functional design documentation and technical approach specifications (use cases and requirements). Communicate daily with project management team internally via e-mail, on the phone and in person to update on project status (typically stand-up format or similar brief update reviews). Work with technical client team members to resolve any technical issues if necessary, (usually via Screenhero, GoToMeeting or similar WebEx style format). Follow internal processes for communicating current project progress, provide timeline estimates, and estimate work orders. Work with clients through debugging and quality assurance cycles.
A typical week will include 4-5 brief stand up meetings to confirm internal status on projects and 1-2 phone meetings with clients (typically facilitated by our PM team) to share updates and provide technical support.

Much of the time, this is wiring Angular logic to back-end workflows via Restful services and creating and validating those Restful services. In addition, this position requires testing of completed features, resolving client trouble tickets, and suggesting improvements to the company and processes during a weekly review meeting.
As Clarity continues to grow over the next 12-18 months, we will be leveraging Client feedback and internal best practices to continue development of a standard code base. In addition, Clarity will continue launching several new updates to our eCommerce and integration framework as well as further enhancing and releasing our business intelligence framework. We operate these product development teams in a scrum agile model for internal development and for many of our client-facing customization projects. This mix of internal and client-facing projects enables team members to grow their skill set as they take on new client challenges, and it also provides a solid framework to consistently build and improve on throughout.
Mandatory Skills:
Visual Studio, C# .NET, ASP.NET, Microsoft SQL Server
Preferred Skills:
Entity Framework, Angular, Team Foundation Server/Git, JIRA, Unit Testing
Minimum Qualifications:
Bachelor degree in computer science or equivalent.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.
We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.
What You'll Achieve:
You'll work with others to build new product features from start to finish: through conception, research, implementation, and maintenance. For example, you might build an editor for inline mathematical equations.
You'll help improve performance and reliability, or polish existing features. For example, you might make it easier to select text across multiple paragraphs.
You'll build internal tools to support simplicity and productivity for the whole team. This might include writing a script to import user feedback into Notion.
Skills You'll Need to Bring:
Thoughtful problem-solving: For you, problem-solving starts with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You can decompose tricky problems and work towards a clean solution, by yourself or with teammates. You're comfortable asking for help when you get stuck.
Shipping quality user interfaces: You can work with others to build and maintain quality user interfaces for a big audience, using Web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a modern UI framework like React. If you've experienced the technical challenges of rapid growth, that's a plus.
Familiarity with the backend: You understand how parts of a system fit together—from the user interface to the data model. Experienced candidates should be familiar with relational database systems like Postgres or MySQL.
Pragmatic and business-oriented: You care about the business impact of what you're building, and you prioritize projects accordingly. You're not just going after cool stuff—you understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line.
Put users first: You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad.
Not ideological about technology: To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go.
Empathetic communication: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed.
Team player: You understand when work is better, together. You enjoy collaborating cross-functionally to accomplish shared goals, and you care about learning, growing, and helping others to do the same.
Nice to Haves:
You're proficient with any part of our technology stack: React, TypeScript, Node.js, and Postgres.
You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work.
You have interests outside of technology, such as in art, history, or social sciences.
We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you're excited about a role but your past experience doesn't align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge.

Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

About the Role
Remember the first time you solved a problem by programming? The delight and excitement you felt when it finally...worked? We want to deliver that experience to everyone by giving them the building blocks to create useful tools of all kinds—without needing to code. That's been the vision of computing pioneers since the 70s. Today, all the infrastructure is present, but we need your engineering to pull it off.
What You'll Achieve:
You'll work with others to build new product features from start to finish: through conception, research, implementation, and maintenance. For example, you might build an editor for inline mathematical equations.
You'll leverage your frontend knowledge to help improve performance and reliability, and polish existing features. For example, you might make it easier to select text across multiple paragraphs.
You'll work across the stack to implement features end-to-end. For example, you might build a new sidebar for displaying page comments, and over the course of implementing it you may modify an existing Node.js endpoint to fetch comment data upon page load.
Skills You'll Need to Bring:
Thoughtful problem-solving: For you, problem-solving starts with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You can decompose tricky problems and work towards a clean solution, by yourself or with teammates. You're comfortable asking for help when you get stuck.
Familiarity with frontend technologies: You're familiar with the DOM, CSS, Javascript, and a React-like UI framework. Based on experience and knowledge of the state of the art in frontend, you make pragmatic suggestions for how to improve our frontend tooling and abstractions. If you've experienced the technical challenges of rapid growth, that's a plus.
Navigating ambiguity in design: You can translate high level designs into production-ready UI. Given clear requirements, you are comfortable making judgment calls on tradeoffs and edge cases in the user experience on your own. You don't need to see every interaction mocked out ahead of time, but you actively partner with designers to suss out the details when the requirements are unclear.
Shipping quality user experiences: You elevate the quality of the product by proactively identifying user experience problems before they ship. You don't just flag issues for others to solve—you communicate potential alternatives and brainstorm solutions with your teammates.
Pragmatic and business-oriented: You care about the business impact of what you're building, and you prioritize projects accordingly. You're not just going after cool stuff—you understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line.
Put users first: You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad.
